## Translation

There is one text file per language (open it with Notepad++ for example, or online using github).
Since there are several people for each language, make sure you talk to each others before you start.
Example: translation_frFR.json is for French

Each file contains strings to translate

Brackets `{` `}` may appear in strings. With some number inside the brackets.
The brackets must appear in the translated string: 
* `loading plugin package: {0}` => `Chargement du plugin: {0}`
* `{0} {1} is only compatible with {2}, however your version is {3}.` => `{0} {1} est compatible uniquement avec {2}, mais votre version est {3}.`

## Tip

It is good that translated strings size (number of characters) is smaller than the original english string

## How-to submit changes

You need to create a branch a make a PR to have any change validated (manually for now)
